This is a small webpage that uses a joke API to generate jokes. it uses three js modules , CSS styling and some minimal HTML structuring.

to use this page just click a button that filters the joke api by joke type and enjoy tthe randome jokes that appear under that category. The punch lines appears after 3 seconds 

based off of how the api works, you have to refresh the page to get acess to more genres to chosse from, there are 4 types max but when they appear is randomized .
