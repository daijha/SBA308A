This is an exam submission for showcasing skills building a JavaScript webpage application. Behold! 


My submission is a small webpage that uses a joke API to generate jokes. It uses three js modules, CSS styling and some minimal HTML structuring.

To use this page just click a button that filters the joke API by joke type and enjoy the random jokes that appear under that category. The punch lines appear after 3 seconds. 

Based off of how the API works, you have to refresh the page to get access to more genres to choose from, there are 4 types max, but when they appear will be randomized. This is one of the quirks in this webpage's construction.

Also keep in mind that each genre has a limited amount of jokes.  The jokes submitted are from volunteers, and there is not an equal amount, so some jokes may repeat in the randomization process.

other than that please enjoy! 
(and please pass me! :D )
